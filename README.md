# Gilded Rose

[The "Gilded Rose"](https://github.com/emilybache/GildedRose-Refactoring-Kata) is a refactoring exercise. This repo is a slightly custom version of that Kata where the explicit aim is to follow a functional approach when rewriting the code.

1. Fork this repo: click `Fork` in the top-right of the page - this will create a copy of this repo in **your own account**

2. Clone (download) the repo
    * Go to your newly-created fork of the repo (on GitHub).
    * Click `Clone or download` (the green button on the right).
    * Make sure the page says `Clone with SSH` (rather than `Clone with HTTPS`).
    * Open your git client (e.g. GitKraken) and use this link to clone the repo.  
    Your trainer will be able to help you with this.

3. "Cloning the repo" will create a folder on your computer with the files from this repo.  
Open this folder in Visual Studio Code.

4. Open a command-prompt in this same folder.  
Your trainer can show you how to do this, if you need any help.

5. Run this command to set up the necessary dependencies:  
`poetry install`

6. Run this command to run all the tests (initially the test in example_test.py should fail):
`poetry run pytest`

# Requirements

See the [Gilded Rose Requirements Specification](./gilded_rose_requirements.md) for a description of what the code is for.
